Patterns (64 bytes each, 32 rows):

0	Note
1	Info + Instrument


Frequency sequence (64 bytes each):

Commands:

$E0 x		Position jump
$E1		End of sequence
$E2 x		Set waveform (will trig it)
$E3 x y	New vibrato
$E4 x		Change waveform (will not trig it, but when the previous waveforms loop, this one is used)
$E7 x		Pattern jump
$E8 x		Set sustain time
$E9 x y	Set sample (x = instrument, y = sample in the instrument)
$EA x y	Pitchbend


Volume sequence (64 bytes each):

Commands:

$E0 x		Position jump
$E1		End of sequence
$E8 x		Set volume sustain
$EA x y	Volume bend


Samples:

0	00	ID (SSMP)
4	04	Sample info (16 bytes for each sample)
		0	Start offset in bytes
		4	Length in words
		6	Loop start offset in bytes
		8	Loop length in words
		10
324	144	Sample data
