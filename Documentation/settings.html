						<h4>Loading</h4>
						<table class="usage2table">
							<tr>
								<td>Double buffering</td>
								<td>NostalgicPlayer loads next module in the list while the actual module is playing. Early load tells NostalgicPlayer how far (positions) from the ending of the current module NostalgicPlayer will start loading the next one. Enabling this feature will make the small pause between module switch very short. It can be used if you e.g. play a MP3 album where each song is merged into each other.</td>

							<tr>
								<td>Stereo separation</td>
								<td>100% is total stereo separation ie. left is left and rigth is right. 0% is mono, which forces NostalgicPlayer to play all sounds in both channels. This can be useful for listening to modules in headphones, where a stereo-separation of 50% will make them sound much better.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Interpolation</td>
								<td>Helps the sound to be less "rough" and make lesser clicks'n'pops. This pretty much resembles the effect of the filter on the Amiga. Interpolation consumes about 25% more cpu-power than usual.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Swap left and right speakers</td>
								<td>Some headphones swaps the left and right speakers. You can then enable this option to swap them back to normal again.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Dolby Prologic surround</td>
								<td>Only supported by a few trackers (ImpulseTracker/ScreamTracker 3) and is rarely used. If you want NostalgicPlayer to reckon this and make a difference between the front and rear speakers, enable this function. Ofcourse this requires a Dolby Prologic amplifier connected to your computer. Module called "Rippless.it" uses surround with the speech sample and "7 seconds.s3m" for the lead, so it can be used for testing purposes.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Emulate Amiga LED filter</td>
								<td>Sets on Amiga LED filter emulation which is basically a low bass filter. Only few mod trackers support this feature.</td>

						<h4>Mixer output</h4>
						<table class="usage2table">

						<h4>Channels</h4>
						<span>
							<p>Most [read: all] modules uses more than one channel, and sometimes you would want to disable certain channels (e.g. the annoying hihat in channel xx). You have the choice between finding the given channel by trying every button one after one, or you can use the buttons to the left which change the state of all the given channels. Try it out!</p>

						<span>
							<p>All players, visuals, sound output etc. are considered as agents, hence this common description of their setting-windows. To the left you can see a list of the available agents with their name and version.</p>
							<p>If agent name is in blue color, it means that it is in use and is used when playing modules, so it is easy to see which player and output agent is used to play that module.</p>
							<p>Like in the other windows, columns can be sorted and moved around as you like. To the right the description of the currently selected agent is shown.</p>
							<p>To disable (prevent it from being loaded) you can double-click any agent.</p>
							<p>Some agents have special settings and to set those, you select the agent and press Settings.</p>
							<p>Some agents have something to display while the music is being played and it can showed by using the Display button.</p>
